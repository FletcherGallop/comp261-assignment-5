Question 1: Write a short summary of the performance you observed using the two search algorithms.
Question 2: Report the binary tree of codes your algorithm generates, and the final size of War and Peace after Huffman coding.
Question 3: Consider the Huffman coding of war_and_peace.txt, taisho.txt, and pi.txt. Which of these achieves the best compression, i.e. the best reduction in size? What makes some of the encodings better than others?
Question 4: The Lempel-Ziv algorithm has a parameter: the size of the sliding window. On a text of your choice, how does changing the window size affect the quality of the compression?
Question 5: What happens if you Huffman encode War and Peace before applying Lempel- Ziv compression to it? Do you get a smaller file size (in characters) overall?
